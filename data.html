Is there a way to create an organization-wide team other than using the 
Teams client? 
Only global admins can create an organization-wide team by using the Teams client. If 
your organization limits creating teams to using PowerShell, the recommended 
workaround is to add your global admins to the security group of users who can create 
a team. 
For more information, see Manage who can create groups. 
If this workaround isn't an option, you can use PowerShell to create a public team and 
add a global admin as the team owner. Then, have the global admin click More 
options next to the team name, click Edit team, and then change the privacy to Org-
wide - Everyone in your organization will be automatically added.
